## How to convert a pdf file to DCM

In ndebele we have a saying which says "indlela ibuzwa kwabaphambili" which simply means 
those who have gone before are the ones who can show the path

I had a hard time figuring this out but you dont have to have a hard time ðŸ˜œ

### Plan

I failed to find a library that can directly convert a pdf file straight to a dcm file so 
i had to convert the pdf file to an image in png or jpg format then convert that genetated
image to a dicom file using a pre-existing dcm file
